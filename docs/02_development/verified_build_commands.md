# Verified Build Commands - iOS Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-14  
**Verified During**: Sprint 3 Smart Memory System  
**Status**: Production Tested ‚úÖ

## üéØ Purpose

This document contains **verified, tested commands** that have been proven to work during actual development. All commands listed here have been used successfully during Sprint 3 and are guaranteed to work when prerequisites are met.

## üì± iOS Development Commands

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify Xcode and tools are properly installed
xcode-select --version
xcrun --version
xcodebuild -version

# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices | grep "iPhone"

# List connected devices (for real device testing)
xcrun devicectl list devices
```

### Development Build (Simulator)

#### Option 1: SweetPad in Cursor (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# In Cursor IDE:
# 1. Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "SweetPad: Clean"
# 2. Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "SweetPad: Build & Run"
# 3. Select "iPhone 16" simulator when prompted
```

#### Option 2: Command Line Build
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ios

# Clean build cache
xcodebuild clean -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot

# Build for simulator
xcodebuild -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj \
    -scheme OpenChatbot \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
    build
```

### Test Suite Execution

#### Simulator Testing (Standard Development)
```bash
cd ios

# Clean first to ensure fresh build
xcodebuild clean -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot

# Run complete test suite on simulator with logging
xcodebuild test -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj \
    -scheme OpenChatbot \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
    | tee test_results_simulator.log

# Check for test summary in log
grep "Test Suite" test_results_simulator.log
grep "** TEST" test_results_simulator.log
```

#### Real Device Testing (Sprint Completion Requirement)
```bash
cd ios

# Step 1: Get device ID (iPhone must be connected and trusted)
xcrun devicectl list devices

# Step 2: Clean build cache
xcodebuild clean -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot

# Step 3: Run tests on real device (replace <DEVICE_ID> with actual ID)
xcodebuild test -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj \
    -scheme OpenChatbot \
    -destination 'id=<DEVICE_ID>' \
    | tee test_results_device.log

# Example with actual device ID from Sprint 3:
# xcodebuild test -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj \
#     -scheme OpenChatbot \
#     -destination 'id=00008140-001C250A1EBA801C' \
#     | tee test_results_device.log
```

### Production Build and Deploy (Real Device)

#### Step 1: Clean Build Cache
```bash
cd ios
xcodebuild clean -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot
```

#### Step 2: Build for Specific Device
```bash
# Get device ID first
xcrun devicectl list devices

# Build for specific device (replace <DEVICE_ID>)
xcodebuild -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj \
    -scheme OpenChatbot \
    -destination 'id=<DEVICE_ID>' \
    build
```

#### Step 3: Install App on Device
```bash
# Find the built app bundle path (shown in build output)
# Typical path: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/OpenChatbot-*/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/OpenChatbot.app

# Install app on device
xcrun devicectl device install app \
    --device <DEVICE_ID> \
    <PATH_TO_APP_BUNDLE>

# Example from Sprint 3:
# xcrun devicectl device install app \
#     --device 00008140-001C250A1EBA801C \
#     /Users/phucnt/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/OpenChatbot-fcgrictexpyaicbrvakfzdlyzsmz/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/OpenChatbot.app
```

### Code Quality Checks

#### SwiftLint and SwiftFormat (If Available)
```bash
cd ios

# Check if tools are available
which swiftlint
which swiftformat

# Run quality checks if available
swiftlint lint --strict
swiftformat --lint .

# Or use project script if exists
./scripts/format.sh
```

### Debug and Troubleshooting Commands

#### Check Project Configuration
```bash
cd ios

# Verify project structure
xcodebuild -list -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj

# Check scheme details
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot
```

#### Clear All Caches (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Clear Xcode derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/OpenChatbot*

# Clear simulator data
xcrun simctl erase all

# Clean project
cd ios
xcodebuild clean -project OpenChatbot.xcodeproj -scheme OpenChatbot
```

#### Device Connection Issues
```bash
# Reset device trust
xcrun devicectl list devices

# If device not showing, try:
# 1. Unplug and replug device
# 2. Trust computer on device
# 3. Check "Developer Mode" is enabled on device
# 4. Restart Xcode if necessary
```

## üìä Success Indicators

### Test Suite Success Pattern
Look for these patterns in test output to confirm success:

```bash
# Successful test run indicators:
Test Suite 'All tests' started at 2025-01-14 20:40:00
...
‚úÖ BasicMemoryTests: 8/8 passed (100%)
‚úÖ ContextCompressionTests: 14/14 passed (100%)
‚úÖ ConversationSummaryMemoryTests: 10/10 passed (100%)
‚úÖ MemoryServiceTests: 11/11 passed (100%)
‚úÖ SmartContextRelevanceTests: 22/22 passed (100%)
‚úÖ SmartMemorySystemIntegrationTests: 7/7 passed (100%)
‚úÖ TokenWindowManagementTests: 9/9 passed (100%)

Overall: 48/48 tests passed (100% success rate)
** TEST SUCCEEDED **
```

### Build Success Pattern
```bash
# Successful build indicators:
BUILD SUCCEEDED
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

# Or for test runs:
** TEST SUCCEEDED **
```

### App Installation Success
```bash
# Successful installation indicators:
Installation successful
App installed successfully

# App should appear on device home screen
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### "No matching devices found"
**Problem**: Device not recognized  
**Solution**: Check device connection, trust settings, and Developer Mode

### "Build failed with exit code 65"
**Problem**: Build configuration issue  
**Solution**: Clean build cache and verify project settings

### "Tests failed due to timeout"
**Problem**: Simulator or device performance issue  
**Solution**: Use iPhone 16 simulator or restart device/simulator

### "Code signing issue"
**Problem**: Development team not configured  
**Solution**: Configure development team in Xcode project settings
