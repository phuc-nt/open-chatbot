### 2. ‚úÖ Actor Isolation Issues Fixed
Successfully resolved Swift Concurrency actor isolation patterns:

#### Fixed Patterns:
- ‚úÖ Added `@MainActor` annotations to all test classes
- ‚úÖ Converted `setUp()` and `tearDown()` to async
- ‚úÖ Fixed service initialization in async context
- ‚úÖ Resolved actor-isolated property access issues

### 3. ‚úÖ CoreDataTests API Mismatches Fixed
Successfully aligned CoreDataTests with current DataService API:

#### Fixed API Calls:

- ‚úÖ Fixed `deleteMessage()` calls to include `from conversation` parameter
- ‚úÖ Updated all message creation to use proper `MessageRole` enum
- ‚úÖ Fixed optional content handling with proper nil coalescing
- ‚úÖ Aligned all test expectations with current service interfaces

### 4. ‚úÖ MockLLMAPIService Unified
Created centralized mock service for all tests:

#### Unified Mock Service:
- ‚úÖ Created shared MockLLMAPIService in BasicMemoryTests.swift
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate mock implementations from other test files
- ‚úÖ Implemented full LLMAPIService protocol compliance
- ‚úÖ Added configurable mock responses and error handling
- ‚úÖ Supports all test scenarios across different test files

### 5. ‚úÖ Basic Memory Tests Working
`BasicMemoryTests.swift` successfully compiles and runs:
- ‚úÖ Memory service initialization tests
- ‚úÖ Conversation memory creation tests
- ‚úÖ Message addition to memory tests
- ‚úÖ Memory statistics retrieval tests
- ‚úÖ Context generation tests
- ‚úÖ Shared MockLLMAPIService implementation
