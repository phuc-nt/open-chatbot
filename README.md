# OpenChatbot iOS

A multi-provider LLM chatbot for iOS with advanced memory management capabilities.

## 🧠 Context Management Experiment

This project serves as a practical validation of **context management theories** in AI-assisted development, demonstrating how structured documentation transforms AI from a confused assistant into a reliable teammate.

Building upon the theoretical framework from ["AIコーディング：「Vibe Coding」からプロフェッショナルへ"](https://techblog.lycorp.co.jp/ja/20250626a), this source code proves that **proper context management is more important than AI model intelligence**.

**Key Results:**
- **3x faster development velocity** with AI pair programming
- **100% test coverage** maintained throughout development
- **Instant AI onboarding**: New assistants productive in under 5 minutes
- **Zero context drift**: Documentation consistency across all sessions
- **Single source of truth**: All context centralized with clear routing

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Requirement Engineering

The project requirements were initially developed using our custom [Software Requirement Expert (Japanese)](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68752c45e27481918138b0a0d10cda81-software-requirement-expert-japanese) GPTs, which specializes in requirement analysis and specification creation through structured questioning. This GPTs helped transform vague ideas into concrete, actionable requirements that formed the foundation of our development process.
