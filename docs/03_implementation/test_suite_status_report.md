## Progress Achieved

### 1. ‚úÖ Architecture Alignment Issues Resolved
Successfully resolved all architecture mismatches identified in previous audit:

#### Fixed API Issues:
- ‚úÖ Added `MemoryStatus: Equatable` for XCTAssertEqual support
- ‚úÖ Implemented missing `getMemoryStatistics()` method in MemoryService
- ‚úÖ Added `compressContextWithImportanceScoring()` alias in ContextCompressionService
- ‚úÖ Implemented `fetchConversations()` and `fetchMessages()` methods in DataService
- ‚úÖ Added `DataService(inMemory: Bool)` constructor for testing

### 2. ‚úÖ Actor Isolation Issues Fixed
Successfully resolved Swift Concurrency actor isolation patterns:

#### Fixed Patterns:
- ‚úÖ Added `@MainActor` annotations to all test classes
- ‚úÖ Converted `setUp()` and `tearDown()` to async
- ‚úÖ Fixed service initialization in async context
- ‚úÖ Resolved actor-isolated property access issues

### 3. ‚úÖ CoreDataTests API Mismatches Fixed
Successfully aligned CoreDataTests with current DataService API:

#### Fixed API Calls:
- ‚úÖ Updated `addMessage()` calls to use `Message` objects instead of `content` + `role` parameters
- ‚úÖ Fixed `deleteMessage()` calls to include `from conversation` parameter
- ‚úÖ Updated all message creation to use proper `MessageRole` enum
- ‚úÖ Fixed optional content handling with proper nil coalescing
- ‚úÖ Aligned all test expectations with current service interfaces

#### Example Fixes:
```swift
// Before (broken)
dataService.addMessage(to: conversation, content: "Hello", role: "user")

// After (working)
let message = Message(content: "Hello", role: .user, conversationId: conversation.id!)
dataService.addMessage(message, to: conversation)
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Basic Memory Tests Working
`BasicMemoryTests.swift` successfully compiles and runs:
- ‚úÖ Memory service initialization tests
- ‚úÖ Conversation memory creation tests
- ‚úÖ Message addition to memory tests
- ‚úÖ Memory statistics retrieval tests
- ‚úÖ Context generation tests
